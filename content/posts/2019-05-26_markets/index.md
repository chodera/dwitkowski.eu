A recent newsletter by the German Open Knowledge Foundation drew attention to the webpage [wo-ist-markt.de](https://wo-ist-markt.de/) which visualizes place and time of weekly markets in different German cities. Being a fan of street markets, I took it as an inspiration to prepare a similar visualiation for the city of Strasbourg. Information on markets was scraped from the city's official [webpage](https://www.strasbourg.eu/marches-brocantes). I took it a as challenge to convert the raw text into a data frame (totally not reproducible but it worked out).
